    RoboCup ball (simple + training-friendly)

    MAIN PHYSICS KNOBS you will likely tune later:

    1) SIZE
       - For a sphere, geom size is the RADIUS in meters.
         size="0.11"  -> diameter 0.22 m
       - Changing radius changes rolling/contact behavior.

    2) MASS / DENSITY
       - Use ONE of:
         a) density="..."  (MuJoCo computes mass = density * volume)
         b) mass="..."     (explicit mass in kg; overrides density)
       - A typical soccer ball mass is about 0.43 kg.
       - If the ball feels too light (flies/jitters), increase mass (or density) a bit.

    3) FRICTION (very important for roll realism)
       friction="slide torsion rolling"
       - slide: tangential friction (how easily it slips)
       - torsion: resistance to spinning at the contact patch (reduces endless spin)
       - rolling: rolling resistance (helps the ball settle and stop)
       Tuning hints:
       - Slips too much -> increase slide (e.g., 1.0)
       - Spins forever  -> increase torsion and/or rolling slightly
       - Stops too fast -> decrease rolling

    4) CONTACT COMPLIANCE / BOUNCINESS
       - solref="timeconst dampratio"
         * larger timeconst => softer contact
         * dampratio controls damping (higher => less bouncy)
       - solimp controls how forces ramp with penetration.
       Tuning hints:
       - Too bouncy -> increase dampratio or soften contact (timeconst up)
       - Too stiff/jittery -> soften contact (timeconst up) and/or increase mass

    5) VISUALS vs PHYSICS
       - Later you can add a visual-only textured mesh without changing physics:
         keep this sphere for collision; add a second visual geom with contype=0, conaffinity=0.

    6) SOLVER / TIMESTEP (global, not in this file)
       If you see jitter at contacts:
       - smaller timestep
       - more solver iterations
       - slightly higher mass
       - slightly softer contact (increase solref timeconst)
